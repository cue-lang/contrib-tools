      "message": "Assuming that our devs can remove result labels, we could then avoid the \"force\" flag - to force a re-run, you\u0027d remove the label and tun the command.\n\nThis is the same Go does, and there is one less knob to know about. Plus, once we switch to a \"pure labels\" approach, we won\u0027t have a way to pass a \"force\" flag anymore, so we\u0027ll need this method anyway - better switch to it now IMO.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not convinced we don\u0027t want the flag. We could/should absolutely support the triggering of the label-based trybots by the \"edge\" that is the addition of the flag, giving devs the ability to remove the vote. But I will always want the ability to trigger (and force) things from the command line: I\u0027m not clear without a `--force` flag by what means I would indicate that I want to force?",
